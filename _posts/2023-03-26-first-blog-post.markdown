This is the first blog post uploaded to the site, which is `very` exciting!

Let's try out a code snippet:

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name):
  return f"Hi, {name}"

print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom'.
{% endhighlight %}

Very nice (if it does end up working, hard to know when writing the code for the website).

Let's try something else, like adding links to another website. For this we will be using [Sune's Github page][suneman-github], which hopefully should be given as a hyperlink now.
